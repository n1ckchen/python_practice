Exercise 2
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.
Sample solution
There are many ways of doing the exercise, so I am posting a few sample solutions. The very basics:

num = input("Enter a number: ")
mod = num % 2
if mod > 0:
    print("You picked an odd number.")
else:
    print("You picked an even number.")

And something that looks slightly more complex (but is just a more complicated conditional):

num = int(input("give me a number to check: "))
check = int(input("give me a number to divide by: "))

if num % 4 == 0:
    print(num, "is a multiple of 4")
elif num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is an even number")
else:
    print(num, "is an odd number")

if num % check == 0:
    print(num, "divides evenly by", check)
else:
    print(num, "does not divide evenly by", check)
