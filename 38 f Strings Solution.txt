Exercise
Implement the same exercise as Exercise 1 (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old), except use f-strings instead of the + operator to print the resulting output message.

Solution
In the exercise 1 solution, we had to convert the variable year into a string so that we could construct a full string and print it. Instead, here we use f-strings to directly convert the variable year into a string using Python internals.

name = input("What is your name: ")
age = int(input("How old are you: "))
year = 2014 - age + 100
print(f"{name}, you will be 100 years old in the year {year}")
