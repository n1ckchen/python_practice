Exercise 4
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

Sample solution
__author__ = 'jeffreyhunt'

num = int(input("Please choose a number to divide: "))

listRange = list(range(1,num+1))

divisorList = []

for number in listRange:
    if num % number == 0:
        divisorList.append(number)

print(divisorList)

There were a number of tricky things with this exercise. First, the type conversions between input strings and integers for the range() function need to be carefully output. Second, the arguments to range() had to be carefully constructed to cover all the possible numbers. Third, the condition in the if statement had to be correct as well.
