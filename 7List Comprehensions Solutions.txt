Exercise 7
Let’s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

Sample solutions
For the meat of the solution, check this out:

b = [element for element in a if element % 2 == 0]

And for a “complete” solution, look at this:

__author__ = 'jhunt'

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = [number for number in a if number % 2 == 0]

print(b)
