Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. Do this without using the Python max() function!

Sample solutions
There are many ways to answer this question, ranging from simple to complex. Here are a few reader-submitted answers!

This first example solution uses a series of if statements and comparisons to find the largest of 3 elements.

def max_of_three(a,b,c):
     max_3=0
     if a>b:
         #max_3=a
         if a>c:
             max_3=c
         else:
             max_3=a
     else:
          if b>c:
             max_3=b
          else:
             max_3=c
     return max_3

Another solution is a little bit less verbose, taking 3 numbers as an input, making them into a list, sorting them, and then reading off the largest element.

This last solution uses a more compact series of if statement comparisons to cover all cases of 3 elements.

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 4:
    print 'Usage <value1> <value2> <value3>'
    sys.exit ( 1 )
    
arg1 = sys.argv[1]
arg2 = sys.argv[2]
arg3 = sys.argv[3]
def maxfunction(a,b,c):
	if (a > b) and (a > c):
	    print 'Max value is :',a
        elif (b > a) and (b > c):
            print 'Max value is :',b
        elif (c > a) and (c > b):
            print 'Max value is :',c
            
maxfunction(arg1,arg2,arg3)


def max_three(a,b,c):
# solution1
# if a > b and a > c:
# return a
# if b > a and b > c:
# return b
# if c > a and c > b:
# return c

#solution2
great_num = a if a > b else b
great_num = great_num if great_num > c else c
return great_num
