Exercise 31
This exercise is Part 2 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 1 and Part 3.

Let’s continue building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program that the player has to guess, letter by letter. The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed. (In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).

Let’s say the word the player has to guess is “EVAPORATE”. For this exercise, write the logic that asks a player to guess a letter and displays letters in the clue word that were guessed correctly. For now, let the player guess an infinite number of times until they get the entire word. As a bonus, keep track of the letters the player guessed and display a different message if the player tries to guess that letter again. Remember to stop the game when all the letters have been guessed correctly! Don’t worry about choosing a word randomly or keeping track of the number of guesses the player has remaining - we will deal with those in a future exercise.

An example interaction can look like this:

>>> Welcome to Hangman!
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
>>> Guess your letter: S
Incorrect!
>>> Guess your letter: E
E _ _ _ _ _ _ _ E
...
And so on, until the player gets the word.

Sample solution
To write the logic of our Hangman game, we need a few components:

A way to store the word in play
Keep track of which letters in the word have already been guessed
Ask the user for a letter and display the results
As a bonus, we can add the component of displaying a different message if the user has already guessed that letter.

Things to keep in mind:

Upper-case letters and lower-case letters are not equal! When you do 'a' == 'A' in Python, the result will be FALSE! So make sure to do all your operations in either lowercase or uppercase.
It is much faster to check whether an element is in a set than a list. This is not important for the correctness of your program, but it is a good thing to keep in mind for when your programs become more complex.
Here is one sample solution:

#! /usr/bin/python3

if __name__ == '__main__':
	print("Welcome to hangman!!")
	word = "EVAPORATE"
	guessed = "_" * len(word)
	word = list(word)
	guessed = list(guessed)
	lstGuessed = []
	letter = input("guess letter: ")
	while True:
		if letter.upper() in lstGuessed:
			letter = ''
			print("Already guessed!!")
		elif letter.upper() in word:
			index = word.index(letter.upper())
			guessed[index] = letter.upper()
			word[index] = '_'
		else:
			print(''.join(guessed))
			if letter is not '':
				lstGuessed.append(letter.upper())
			letter = input("guess letter: ")

		if '_' not in guessed:
			print("You won!!")
			break
