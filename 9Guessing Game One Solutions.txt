Exercise 9
Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise).

Extras:

Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.
Sample solution
Great example of a solution including both extras!

And another:

import random

rd = random.randint(1,9)
guess = 0
c = 0
while guess != rd and guess != "exit":
    guess = input("Enter a guess between 1 to 9")

    if guess == "exit":
        break

    guess = int(guess)
    c += 1

    if guess < rd:
        print("Too low")
    elif guess > rd:
        print("Too high")
    else:
        print("Right!")
        print("You took only", c, "tries!")
input()
