Exercise 14
Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.
Sample solution
This solution has two different functions doing the solution in two ways - one does it with a loop, and one with sets!

# Exercise 13:
# Write a function that takes a list and returns a new list that contains 
# all the elements of the first list minus duplicates.

# this one uses a for loop
def dedupe_v1(x):
  y = []
  for i in x:
    if i not in y:
      y.append(i)
  return y

#this one uses sets
def dedupe_v2(x):
    return list(set(x))

a = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]
print a
print dedupe_v1(a)
print dedupe_v2(a)
