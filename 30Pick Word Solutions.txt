Exercise 30
This exercise is Part 1 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2 and Part 3.

In this exercise, the task is to write a function that picks a random word from a list of words from the SOWPODS dictionary. Download this file and save it in the same directory as your Python code. This file is Peter Norvigâ€™s compilation of the dictionary of words used in professional Scrabble tournaments. Each line in the file contains a single word.

Hint: use the Python random library for picking a random word.

Sample solution
To solve this exercise, you need to do three things:

Read all the lists of words
Generate a random number
Take that word
Here is a sample solution:

Here is an alternate approach, with some comments:

  # import the random library
  import random

  # read all the list of words
  words = []
  with open('sowpods.txt', 'r') as f:
    line = f.readline().strip()
    words.append(line)
    while line:
      line = f.readline().strip()
      words.append(line)

  # generate a random number
  random_index = random.randint(0, len(words))

  # take the word
  print("Random word: ", words[random_index])
