Exercise 3
Take a list, say for example this one:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
Write this in one line of Python.
Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
Sample solution
I will note that none of the solutions that were submitted were written in one line of Python. There will be more exercises later that show you how to do this!

Here is a sample solution that solves the exercise, including extras 1 and 2.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

# basic problem:
for x in a:
    if x< 5: print(x)

# combine challenges 1 and 2:
print( [ x for x in a if x<5 ] )

And here is a sample solution that solves the exercise with extra 3.

#Create lists
numbers = [7,3,13,6,8,5,1,2,4,15,9,10,12,14,11]
lessFnums = []
lessNnums =[]
#Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.
for num in numbers:
    if num < 5: #Compare numbers in list against 5
        lessFnums.append(num) #Add numbers that are less than 5 to our list
        lessFnums.sort() # Sort list
#Print the List
print(lessFnums)
print()

# Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) #Get a number from user
for n in numbers:
    if n < num: #Compare user number against numbers in list
        lessNnums.append(n) #Add numbers that are less than user name to our list
        lessNnums.sort() # Sort list
#Print the list
print(lessNnums)
