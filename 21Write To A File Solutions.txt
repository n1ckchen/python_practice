Exercise 21
Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code, use the code from the solution), and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Extras:

Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
Sample solution
The sample solution takes the out-of-the-box solution for Exercise 17 and adds two components:

Asking the user for the name of a file
Substitutes every print statement with a statement writing to a file
Here is the full solution:

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
 
base_url = 'http://www.nytimes.com'
r = requests.get(base_url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text)

filename = input("File to save to: ")

with open(filename, 'w') as f:
  for story_heading in soup.find_all(class_="story-heading"): 
      if story_heading.a: 
          f.write(story_heading.a.text.replace("\n", " ").strip())
      else: 
          f.write(story_heading.contents[0].strip())
