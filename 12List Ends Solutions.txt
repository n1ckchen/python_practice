Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

Sample solution
def list_ends(a_list):
    return [a_list[0], a_list[len(a_list)-1]]


    // return [a[0], a[-1]]
